# Examples of conditional config inclusion

# includeIf with hasconfig not very well supported for an account under a domain
#
# [includeIf "hasconfig:remote.practicalli.url:git@github.com:practicalli/*.git"]
# 		path = config-practicalli

# ----------------------------------------
# SSH Remote URI

# Set config to be used with any repository hosted on GitHub
# [includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:ssh://git@github.com/**"]
# 		path = config-github

# Set config to use with any repository containing practicalli in its remote URL
# [includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:**/practicalli/**"]
# 		path = config-practicalli

# Set config to use with any repository in practicalli GitHub Org
# [includeIf "hasconfig:remote.practicalli.url:git@github.com:practicalli/**"]
# 		path = config-practicalli

# TODO: Investigate what happens if there are two remotes,
# each with their own IncludeIf match

# Commercial work - by shared repository URL
